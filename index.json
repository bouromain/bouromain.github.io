I did my PhD (and wrote a thesis) at the Institut de Neurobiologie de la Méditerranée in the beautiful city of Marseille in the team of Dr. Jérôme Epsztein.\nMy research focus on how information from the outside world influences our cognitive map in a region called the hippocampus. For this I use a combination of methods (electrophysiology, calcium imaging\u0026hellip;) to monitor neuronal activity while animal perform behavioural tasks in Virtual Reality.\nI also really like to code and love doing data science, machine learning on neural activity to better understand how information is encoded by neurons. You can find most of my code on GitHub .\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Homepage ","summary":"I am a neuroscientist currently working in UCL in the team of the Prof.","title":"About Me"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"You can drop me a line in english and/or french here:\nEmail LinkedIn Mastodon Bluesky ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/contact/","section":"Homepage ","summary":"You can drop me a line in english and/or french here:","title":"Contact"},{"content":"Hi there 👋🏻,\nI am a neuro | data scientist living in London with a passion for understanding how\n🧠 real and 🤖 artificial neurons store information.\nI have more than 10 years of experience working in academia as a neuroscientist.
