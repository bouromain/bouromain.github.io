I am a neuroscientist currently working in UCL in the team of [Prof. Caswell Barry](https://barry-lab.com/). I did my PhD [(and wrote a thesis)](https://www.theses.fr/en/2019AIXM0299) at the [Institut de Neurobiologie de la Méditerranée](https://www.inmed.fr/en) in the beautiful city of Marseille in the team of [Dr. Jérôme Epsztein](https://www.inmed.fr/en/neuronal-coding-of-space-and-memory).


My research focuses on how information from the outside world influences our [cognitive map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_map) in a region called the [hippocampus](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hippocampus). For this I use a combination of methods (electrophysiology, calcium imaging...) to monitor neuronal activity while animals perform behavioural tasks in [Virtual Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DJOTEDBA2c).

Aside from recording neural activity, I developed various data cleaning and analysis pipelines, but also applied machine learning methods on neural activity to better understand the information they encode. You can find most of my code on [GitHub {{< icon "github" >}}](https://github.com/bouromain).


<!-- My previous/current work mostly focussed on the following questions:
- How our cognitive map adapts its resolution to the availability of sensory information in an environment? 
- How the brain stores a high number of "maps" without mixing them

In collaboration with others, I've also studied:
- neurons activated sequentially during behaviour are "reactivated" during rest
- [phase coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_precession) of neurons is affected by novelty 
-  How neuroscience and artificial intelligence can  -->
