Hi there 👋🏻, 

I am a **neuro | data scientist** living in **London** with a passion for understanding how 

🧠 real  and 🤖 artificial neurons store information.

I have more than 10 years of experience working in [academia as a neuroscientist](about). My research mainly focuses on understanding how we form internal representations of our environment to navigate in it. 

📫 You [reach me here](contact) in english and/or french.
